# @shared/theme

This is a standalone library with minor dependencies. 

You can use the theme by importing the bundled css file like `import "@datev-research/mandat-shared-theme/theme.css";` or using the github 
dependency like `import "@datev-research/mandat-shared-theme/theme.css";`.

The theme contains and defines several custom properties that you can use. It is also based on primeflex.
